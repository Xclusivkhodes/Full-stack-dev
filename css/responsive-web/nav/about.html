            <strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong>, 
            I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was
             I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. 
             <br>
             <br>
             Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, 
             and I couldn't hold a relationship.
             <br>
             <br>
             <span class="featured-heading">How I turned things around</span>
             <br>
             <br>
             <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
             <br><br>
             It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
             <br><br>
            <span class="featured-heading">Now I live the simple life</span>
            <br><br>
            Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
            <br><br>
            With how much it turned my life around, <strong>felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
